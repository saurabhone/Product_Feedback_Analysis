# Product_Feedback_Analysis
Social Media is playing an important role in marketing of a product. This social media can also be used to know the customer's opinions on improvising the product's features, it's quality and many other things. Sentimental Analysis can roughly give us an idea about the future demand of the product which can help us in increasing the revenue and cutting down on manufacturing costs. In this Jupyter Notebook, we will do the sentimental analysis on a car model and for analysis purpose we will take the comments as the data from it's Facebook post. We will use Python libraries along with Facebook Graph API to achieve our goal.
